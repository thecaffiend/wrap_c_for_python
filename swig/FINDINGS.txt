# Con
* gross code
* little control of the generated stuff. (e.g. char string max len 32 throws
  a TypeError if len exceeded. rather than truncating the str at max len here,
  it has to be handled elsewhere, like in a wrapper class)

# Pro
* Very easy to use (for this case)
* no dependencies (other than swig)
* good/large community
