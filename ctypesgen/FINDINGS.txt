# Con
* python2 only...
* little control of the generated stuff. (e.g. char string max len 32 throws
  a ValueError if len exceeded. rather than truncating the str at max len here,
  it has to be handled elsewhere, like in a wrapper class)

# Pro
* Very easy to use
* no installation
* no dependencies
